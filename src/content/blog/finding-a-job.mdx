Find a dev job in 2024 is hard. Between layoffs, remote work, and companies just not hiring, it's a crowded market to say the least. As someone who's had to find new jobs three times in the last year and a half as a result of lay offs, I've had my fair share of experience navigating the tough spot developers are in today.

You spend countless hours submitting Quick Apply after Quick Apply, only to never hear back. The first question is why? It comes down to a numbers game. I'm sure you see that most of the jobs you're applying to already have hundreds of applicants, that's just the norm in today's job market. Even if you're in the top 10% of applicants to one of these jobs, that still means there are dozens of candidates who will get a callback before you do.
