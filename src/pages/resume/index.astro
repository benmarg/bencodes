      Hi I’m Ben Margolius, a Seattle-based Full Stack developer working primarily with React, Next.js and Typescript.
      <div class="my-4">
      I’m passionate about creating beautiful solutions that solve real problems. 
      <div class="my-4">
      I don’t just live inside my Text Editor - I go outside and talk to users. 
      <div class="my-4">

      I think outside-the-box to solve user problems, even if that solution doesn’t involve a single line of code.
    </p>

<p>To wrap things up, a quote I think about often when working on solutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be guided by beauty. I really mean that. Pretty much everything I’ve done has had an aesthetic component, at least to me. Now you might think ‘well, building a company that’s trading bonds, what’s so aesthetic about that?’ But, what’s aesthetic about it is doing it right. Getting the right kind of people, and approaching the problem, and doing it right […] it’s a beautiful thing to do something right.” - Jim Simons</p>
