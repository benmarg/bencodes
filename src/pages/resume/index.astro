      Hi! I'm Ben,  a Seattle-based Full Stack developer working day-to-day with  React, Next.js, Typescript, and more! 
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm passionate about creating beautiful solutions that solve real problems for users. That means I don't just start and stop my day in VSCode. I go out, talk to users, think outside-the-box, and come up with a game plan that solves the problem, with strong opinions loosely held, even if that doesn't involve a single line of code.
